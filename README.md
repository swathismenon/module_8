# WebXR Canvas Panel Project

## Phase 1: Interactive VR Canvas Implementation

### Features
- 320x180 canvas panel in VR space
- Positioned 2 meters in front at eye level (1.6m height)
- Interactive raycasting from VR controllers
- Double-sided canvas visibility
- Proper lighting setup for better visibility

### Technical Implementation
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- WebXR API for VR functionality
- VR Controller support with raycasting
- Canvas interaction only activates after entering VR mode

### Project Structure
```

├── index.html          # Main HTML file with VR button
├── main.js            # Core WebXR and Three.js implementation
├── package.json       # Project dependencies
└── package-lock.json  # Dependency lock file
```

### Dependencies
- Three.js (v0.160.0)
- Vite (v5.0.0) for development server

### Setup Instructions
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start development server:
```bash
npm start
```

3. Access the application:
- Open browser (preferably Chrome)
- Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
- Click "VR" button to enter VR mode
- Use VR controllers to interact with the canvas

### VR Interaction
- Canvas appears as a floating panel in VR space
- Point controllers at the canvas
- Press trigger to draw red dots at intersection points
- Canvas is visible from both sides

### Technical Notes
- WebXR features are enabled only after entering VR mode
- Raycasting is implemented for precise pointer interaction
- Ambient and directional lighting for optimal visibility
- Controller models are loaded for better visual feedback

### Testing Requirements
- Compatible VR headset or Meta Quest Emulator
- WebXR-compatible browser (Chrome recommended)
- Local development server running
